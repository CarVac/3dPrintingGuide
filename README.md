# 3D Printing Guide

A (hopefully) up-to-date repository of best practices for FFF/FDM 3D printer design.

# Motion

XY Motion Systems (CoreXY vs Bedslinger vs Delta vs Cross Gantry)

Z Motion Systems (Cantilever, Dual/Triple Dependent, Dual/Triple Independent, Flying Gantry, bedslinger single/dual z, corexz

Linear Guides (rails, rods, wheels)

Stepper Motors (inertia, torque curves, temperature, resistance/inductance, 0.9 vs 1.8 degree)

Drive Mechanisms (belts, leadscrews, ballscrews)

# Where the Plastic hits the Plate

Filament extrusion overview

Extruders (single, dual gear, hob size, runout etc)

Direct drive vs Bowden

Hotends (heatbreak, meltzone, structural support)

Nozzles (materials, coatings, form factor, high flow geometries)

Part cooling

Bed surfaces and surface treatments

# Structure

Frame design

Frame assembly (straightening)

Toolhead structure (particularly regarding balance)

Bed structure

# Software, Electronics, Power, and Sensors

MCUs

Motor Drivers

Toolhead Boards

Limit Switches

Bed Level Sensors

Chamber Heaters

Wires

Temperature Measurement (thermistors, thermocouples, RTDs)

Input Shaping overview

Temperature Control overview

Klipper, Marlin, RRF specifics

# Printing Materials

Primary materials

Reinforcement/Fill Materials (glass, CF, metal, inhomogeneous plastic "silk")

Support materials

Filament dryers

Material switchers (MMU/AMS vs IDEX vs toolchanger)
